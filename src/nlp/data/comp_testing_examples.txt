#### These are examples of component testing reports ####
Since the pump had been sitting idle for over 20 years there was some corrosion on the casing. 
Prior to the start of the pump test, the casing  was brushed and swabbed. 
The test started at 8:30am on October 13th at maximum power.
A 2-hour constant rate pump test was conducted. 
A constant rate of 400gpm was measured.
Inspection of pump controller did not show any deterioration.
Power cables and connectors are not showing any sign of oxidation.
Pump impeller has been inspected and minor blade corrosion has been found.
The pump was able to reach a stable flow rate at approximately 350gpm after 20 seconds.
A constant pump discharge pressure of 20 psig was observed 15 seconds after start-up.
A total of two pressure transducers were used.
Nominal pumping rate was difficult to obtain due to transducer failure.
