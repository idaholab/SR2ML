Pump outgoing flow was significantly reduced since imbalance of the shaft.
AC power was interrupted for about 2 hours; for that reason the pump flow was halted.
When AC power was interrupted for about 2 hours, thus, pump flow was halted.
Pump flow was halted; this was due to AC power and shaft was interrupted for about 2 hours.
Pump outgoing flow was significantly reduced. This was caused by imbalance of the shaft.
AC power was interrupted for about 2 hours. Consequently, pump flow was halted.
When AC power was interrupted for about 2 hours. This resulted in reduced pump flow.
Pump flow was halted. It was because AC power was interrupted for about 2 hours.
The cause of the failure of the steam supply valve was disengagement of the torque arm from the stem key.
With the torque arm disengaged from the key, the valve stem rotated and caused the geared limit switch settings for the motor operator to become out of sync with the valve travel.
As a result, the limit switches did not actuate at the expected set points.
