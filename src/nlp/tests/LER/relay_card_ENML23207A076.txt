On April 5th, 2023, Duke Catawba Nuclear Station informed Paragon of a failure of the relay card
upon installation into the CH-531 control panel during planned maintenance on the chiller system.
Following replacement, the relay module bound to the Adaptiview system correctly, but the chiller
attempted to start without signal to start from the control room. The issue was discovered when
the chiller initiated diagnostics for missing evaporator water flow. Flow was not maintained on
the chiller due to continued maintenance; however, an internal failure of the 1A13 Module (X13650728-06)
caused the module to read a closed contact at terminals J3-1/2 which would ordinarily come from
closure of the control room start contact. The failure was readily determined during system restoration.

The affected card was originally supplied to Catawba in December 2024 with three other
units which have been tested satisfactorily at the plant. The specific failure noted above
would not prevent the chiller from performing its safety function. To date this is the only
failure of the affected part number which has been reported to Paragon. Our analysis of the failed
relay card has identified minor delamination and water intrusion of the microcontroller chip
(date code 1308) installed. This is the only anomaly identified to date, and therefore it is
difficult to determine 1) if this condition could exist in more units and 2) if this condition
prevent the chiller from performing its safety function.
