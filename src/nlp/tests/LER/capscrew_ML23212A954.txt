The 1/4" Socket Head Capscrew (Part No. 48 in the valve drawing) installed to each of the supplied check valuves was shorter than the required 1.25" length. The capscrew connects the Cylinder Rod Extension to the Hinge Shaft Actuactor Arm. The shortened capscrew limited the thread engagement with the Cylinder Rod Extension to apprximately two to three threads and had the risk of coming loose and falling out. Loss of the capscrew could potentially create binding to prevent the valve from opening and closing, which in turn limits the emergency feedwater flow to all three steam generators when needed. This condition also has the potential to affect the isolation function of the check valve.
