On July 20, 2023, at 1507 EDT, the Department was notified by the licensee that while performing semi-annual shutter checks the licensee discovered that the handle on a Berthold LB7440D had broken off which prevented the shutter from being locked. The licensee cordoned off the area and was able to rotate the shutter to the closed and shielded position. The gauge is a Berthold Model LB7440D s/n FT314 and contains a 30 mCi Cesium-137 source. On July 21, 2023, BRH [Bureau of Radiological Health] on-call duty officer met licensee's RSO at 0800, to perform a visual inspection and radiation survey of the gauge. The highest radiation measured was 0.2 mR/hr. The licensee has contacted a licensed vendor to schedule the repair of the handle.
