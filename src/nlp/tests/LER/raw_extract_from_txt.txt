Investigation revealed that the steam dump control relay had failed, rendering all four NRC Region Ill Regional Administrator atmospheric steam dump valves (ASDVs) inoperable. cc: NRC Senior Resident Inspector - Palisades NRC Project Manager - Palisades The relay was replaced and the ASDVs were returned to service. The plant remained stable in Mode 1 at 100% power throughout the event. The safety significance of this event was minimal.
