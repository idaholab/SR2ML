Rupture of pump bearings likely caused shaft degradation.
Pump power supply seems burnout.
Pump test failed unlikely due to power supply failure.
The valve is about a twenty-nine years old.
It is almost five years since it was replaced.
The pump failed first, then the system failed.
The system failed following the pump failure.
The motor failed while the pump stopped working.
The water leakage is happened above the pump.
The oil puddle is found next to the motor.
The debris is located below the generator.
